# ReZeroGame
This is a game developed during the past year. 

All the assets are here together with the scenes etc. It should be enough to recreate our game. 

Charaters belong to their respect owners. 
Due to the "Law of Doujinshi" from Japan, I declare no right to the original characters in this game.
